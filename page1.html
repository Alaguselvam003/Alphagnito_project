            <!-- Paragraph 1 -->
            <p class="storm-text" style="height: 250px; margin-top: 30px;">
                <strong>1     </strong>Meteorologists are scientists who study the weather. They watch weather patterns and use instruments to measure things like temperature, wind speed, and other atmospheric conditions. With this information, they make predictions about the weather, including warnings about dangerous storms.
            </p>

            <!-- Paragraph 2 -->
            <p class="storm-text" style="height: 250px; margin-top: 50px;">
                <strong>2     </strong>Severe storms often bring powerful winds and heavy precipitation, such as rain or snow. These storms can take different forms, including tornadoes, hurricanes, or blizzards. They tend to occur in specific regions during certain seasons, but even then, they can still be difficult to forecast exactly.
            </p>

            <!-- Paragraph 3 -->
            <p class="storm-text" style="height: 250px; margin-top: 40px;">
                <strong>3     </strong>Storm spotters assist meteorologists by observing the sky and watching for signs of developing storms. They are trained volunteers who report what they see. Their reports help meteorologists make more accurate predictions. Spotters can also help track how strong a storm is and which direction it is moving.
            </p>

            <!-- Paragraph 4 -->
            <p class="storm-text" style="height: 250px; margin-top: 40px;">
                <strong>4     </strong>When meteorologists determine that a severe storm may occur, local governments and emergency agencies issue weather alerts. These warnings inform people when the storm is expected to arrive and advise them to take shelter. Alerts may be shared through news reports, text messages, or outdoor warning sirens.
            </p>

            <!-- Paragraph 5 -->
            <p class="storm-text" style="height: 250px; margin-top: 50px;">
                <strong>5     </strong>Serious storms can cause destruction and dangerous conditions. When this happens, first responders ensure that people remain safe. They rescue individuals trapped by floods or debris and provide assistance to those who are injured or in need of food, clothing, or shelter.
            </p>

            <!-- Paragraph 6 -->
            <p class="storm-text" style="height: 250px; margin-top: 70px;">
                <strong>6     </strong>Predicting storms is difficult, and sometimes bad weather forms quickly. Even with advanced tools, meteorologists may not always foresee storms in time to prevent damage. However, their work still helps communities prepare and stay safer during severe weather.
